## About
Generates a REST API to query your dbt metrics using https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt_metrics

## Installation
### Prerequisites
1. A [dbt project](https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/setting-up)
2. Node

## Usage
### Routes
dbt-metrics-api has 3 routes:
#### GET `/metrics`
- returns a JSON array of your project's metrics
- supports "name", "type", "model", and "package_name" query strings for filtering
- ```json
    $ curl -X GET "http://localhost:3002/metrics?type=count&package_name=jaffle_shop"
    [{"unique_id":"metric.jaffle_shop.orders","package_name":"jaffle_shop","model":"ref('orders')","name":"orders","description":"The number of orders","label":"Orders","type":"count","filters":[],"time_grains":["day","week","month","quarter","year"],"dimensions":["status","customer_id"]},{"unique_id":"metric.jaffle_shop.orders2","package_name":"jaffle_shop","model":"ref('orders')","name":"orders2","description":"The number of orders","label":"Orders","type":"count","filters":[],"time_grains":["day","week","month","quarter","year"],"dimensions":["status","customer_id"]}]
    ```
#### GET `/metrics/:metric_name`
- returns a JSON object with keys `unique_id, package_name, model, name, description, label, type, filters, time_grains, dimensions`
- ```json
    $ curl -X GET "http://localhost:3002/metrics/orders"
    {"unique_id":"metric.jaffle_shop.orders","package_name":"jaffle_shop","model":"ref('orders')","name":"orders","description":"The number of orders","label":"Orders","type":"count","filters":[],"time_grains":["day","week","month","quarter","year"],"dimensions":["status","customer_id"]}
    ```
#### POST `/metrics/:metric_name`
- Queries a metric and returns the result
- Accepts a JSON object in the request body with the following properties: `grain, dimensions, start_date, end_date` (`start_date` and `end_date` are optional)
- Returns a JSON object or CSV depending on your `Accept:` header (`application/json` or `text/csv`)
- ```json
    $ curl http://localhost:3002/metrics/orders -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d '{"grain": "year", "start_date": "2017-01-01", "end_date": "2019-01-01"}'
    [{"period": "2017-01-01", "orders": 0.0}, {"period": "2018-01-01", "orders": 99.0}, {"period": "2019-01-01", "orders": 0.0}]
    ```

### Authentication
dbt-metrics-api supports [Kable](https://kable.io) for authentication.

To get started:
1. Sign up at https://kable.io (the free tier includes unlimited test requests and up to 10,000 live requests)
2. Note your client ID and secret and add them to your `server/.env.local` file:
```bash
KABLE_CLIENT_ID=
KABLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# you will need to set to LIVE in production
KABLE_ENV=TEST
```
3. Requests will now require authentication with a customer ID and secret that you set up in your Kable dashboard using `X-CLIENT-ID` and `X-API-KEY` headers
```json
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:3002/metrics/orders" -H "X-CLIENT-ID: test-customer-1" -H "X-API-KEY: sk_test.some.secret.key"
```
